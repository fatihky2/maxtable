#summary High-level overview of MaxTable.

*Overview*

Maxtable consists of three components:
  # *Metadata server*: This provides the global namespace for all the tables in this system. It keeps the B-tree structure in memory.
  # *Ranger server*: SStable is one file saved in the Ranger sever and it is split into blocks. Each block is 64KB in size. One SSTable contains 16 blocks.
  # *Client library*: The client library is linked with applications. This enables applications to read/write files stored in Maxtable.
