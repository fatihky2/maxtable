#summary High-level overview of MaxTable.

*Overview*

  # Maxtable consists of three components:
    * *Metadata server*: This provides the global namespace for all the tables in this system. It keeps the B-tree structure in memory.
    * *Ranger server*: SStable is one file saved in the Ranger sever and it is split into blocks. Each block is 64KB in size. One SSTable contains 16 blocks.
    * *Client library*: The client library is linked with applications. This enables applications to read/write files stored in Maxtable.                                 
  # How to store the table in the disk ?

    * One SSTable = 1 M data.
    * One Tablet = 4K SSTable.
    * One Table = 4K Tablet.
So, one table can contain 16T data, or 64 PB data if we use two tablet levels to save index data.
