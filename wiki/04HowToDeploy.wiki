#summary How to deploy MaxTable servers on a cluster.

==Defining Machine Configuration for MaxTable==
Maxtable can use the local system or Kosmos file system (KFS) as its back-end storage engine. If using the KFS as the back-end storage, you need to build the library for the KFS and link it into the binary (startMaster and startRanger).

  * Build library including the client API of DFS
