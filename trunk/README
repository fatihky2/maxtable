1. Building

If using the Kosmos file system as your back-end storage engine, you should set the MT_BACKEND with 'KFS'
	export MT_BACKEND=KFS

and set the MT_DFS_CLI_LIB_PATH and MT_DFS_INCLUDE_PATH with your path of KFS's LIB and include.
	export MT_DFS_CLI_LIB_PATH=~/kosmos/build/src/cc/libkfsClient
	export MT_DFS_INCLUDE_PATH=~/kosmos/src/cc

	cp libkfsCommon.so libkfsIO.so libqcdio.so libkfsClient.so ~/kosmos/build/src/cc/libkfsClient

else if using the local system as the storage engine, please set it as follows:
	export MT_BACKEND=LOCAL

make clean
make

./startMaster
./startRanger

2. Sample Test
